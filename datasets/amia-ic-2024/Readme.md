# SDoH-Clinical Relations Dataset

The SDOH-Clinical relations dataset was constructed by extracting a random set of sentences from PubMed annotated with a UMLS annotator (MetaMap) where at least one concept in that sentence is a disease (as defined by UMLS semantic type) and the other is an entity representing an SDOH domain as defined by the Health & Social Person-centric Ontology (HSPO).
