Please see the Ontology Specification for further technical details. Overview HSPO is an ontology that aims to build a holistic view centered around the individual and spans across their multiple facets (e.g. clinical, social, behavior). This ontology allows users to: Create star-shaped person-centered knowledge graphs which can then be, for example, translated into graph embeddings and used for downstream prediction or inference tasks Lift data from transactional records (e.g. Electronic Health Records) into a graph representation (e.g. represent a patient's hospital admission) Create a cohort of interest (e.g. group of patients in a clinical trial sharing similar characteristics) Mapping between existing terminologies and standards (e.g. UMLS, ICD) Annotation of unstructured data written in natural language The ontology also defines the notion of evidence (e.g. information or knowledge extracted from research publications, statistical models, etc) which, in turn, enables graph completion. For example, the graph of an individual patient may be completed with information extracted from external sources of evidence (e.g. a research paper) and accompanied by a confidence score. In the next chapter we will cover the available Ontology classes .","title":"Overview"},{"location":"#documentation-user-guide","text":"Documentation under construction.

Please see the Ontology Specification for further technical details. The central point of a graph is a person (Class: Person) and has the following facets (ontology classes): Disease Social Context Behavior Intervention Demographics Age Gender Race & Ethnicity Marital Status Religion Location Evidence HSPO classes will continue to be reviewed and extended in the future. Disease HSPO uses the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) for diagnosis definition. Diagnoses are defined by the Disease class. The EFO ontology includes links to other terminologies and classification systems as exemplified in Figure 1. Figure 1. Example of adding a disease to patient Sam. Social Context The HSPO defines 11 different social context domains: Social Context Description Built Environment The location surrounding an individual including neighborhood. Educational The educational attainment and literacy of an individual. Employment The labor context of an individual including unemployment. Financial The financial context of an individual including economic stability, material hardship and medical cost burden. Food Security The context in which an individual consumes or has access to food including nutritious or fresh foods and food poverty. Health and Welfare System The context and environment in which healthcare or social welfare are provided including access to services. Housing The physical environment context in which an individual finds shelter and/or resides. Judicial The judicial context of an individual including imprisonment, involvement in legal actions or jury duty. Political The political and government context of an individual including political affiliations and distrust in government institutions. Interpersonal, Social and Community Environment The social environment context of an individual including interpersonal relationships, community and culture. Transportation The context in which an individual requires to travel between locations including commuting. The above social context domains were derived based on definitions of the social determinants of health from the following sources: HL7 Gravity Project WHO Social Determinants of Health Healthy People 2030 ICD-11 Factors influencing health status or contact with health services ICD-10 Z Codes Behavior Work in progress. Intervention HSPO defines the class intervention as a way to represent both social or clinical intervention including medical procedures, medication provision, social programs, etc. Intervention Types The intervention types used in the HSPO ontology are defined by the HL7 Gravity Project Interventions Framework which includes 8 different intervention types ( see example for Food Insecurity domain ). Demographics The following demographics facets (classes) are included in this ontology: Age Gender Race & Ethnicity Marital Status Religion Location Evidence Work in progress.","title":"Classes"},{"location":"classes/#classes","text":"Documentation under construction.
