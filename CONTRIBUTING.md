## Contributing

We need your help to continue to develop this project!

This project welcomes contributions from anyone interested in one or more areas covered by the HSPO ontology (e.g. healthcare, social care) or anyone interested in methods that can leverage the ontology (e.g. knowledge graphs, graph embeddings).

We are currently in the process of writing the guidelines for new contributions and will be updating this page with more information soon. In the meantime, if you'd like to get involved please e-mail one of the maintainers listed in the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) page.
